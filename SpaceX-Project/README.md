- This project aimed to answer the possibility of predicting the success of landing of the rocketâ€™s first stage to reduce the overall cost of launching rocket.
- The analysis was based on SpaceX historical launch data
- The data was collected from a publicly available SpaceX API, and web scraping of wiki pages about SpaceX rocket flights information
- Data was preprocessed to replace missing values
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL to better understand the data
- Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and PlotlyDash to better relate the data to the geographical locations
- Performed predictive analysis using various classification models
